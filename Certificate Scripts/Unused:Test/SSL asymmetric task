1.Computers agree on how to encrypt
	Client sends hello to Server:
	Key - RSA
	Cipher - AES
	Hash - HMAC-SHA
		message authnetication
	SSL Version (SSLv3)
	Random Number

	Server sends hello to Client:
	Key - RSA
	Cipher - AES
	Hash - HMAC-SHA


2. Server sends a certficate
	Server sends Certificate to Client:
	Serial
	Issuer
	Valid from - to
	PUBLIC KEY
	Subject

3.	Client says start encrypting
	Client key exchange
		a.	Both computers calculate a master secret code using
			the random number in hello

		b.	Change Cipher spec
			Client asks Server to encrypt with agreed upon AES

		c.	Finish message

4.	Server starts encrypting
		a.	Sends the cipher spec to client as agreed upon in hello
			AES encrypt
		b.	Ready / Finished (ENCRYPTED IN AES)

Certificate Authority
	1.	Asks for information
		a.	web serve, company,location
		b.	Certificate Authority does fact checking in real life
	2.	Creates Certificate
	3.	Signs certificate
		a. version
		b. serial
		c. algorithm id
		d. issuer
		e. validity (from - to)
		f. Company details
		g. Subject
		i. public key info
			ALGORITHM
			KEY
		j. identifier
		k. identifier for company
		l. signature algorithm
		m. signature
			Signature created by condensing all details into a number through hashing

		This number is then encrypted with a private key, anyone holding the corresponding public key can see it is correct.

	4.	Certificate installed in server
